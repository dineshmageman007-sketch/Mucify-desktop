r"""
Per-playlist folders and the "last processed file" memory.

Every playlist gets its own folder inside the working folder:

    <working folder>\<Playlist name>\
        1_to_download.csv   what still needs downloading (after the Playlist Manager)
        2_enriched.csv      the same tracks with Qobuz quality info
        3_skipped.csv       everything that did NOT get downloaded
        4_successful.csv    everything that DID get downloaded

The playlist name comes from the CSV the user feeds in. Later stages recognise
files that already live in a playlist folder and keep using that folder.
